# TCP_Case_Study
The original design of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) worked reliably, but was unable to provide acceptable performance in large and congested networks. Several TCP variants have been proposed since then (TCP Tahoe, Reno, NewReno, Vegas, BIC, CUBIC, SACK, and others) with mechanisms to control and avoid congestion. The objective of this project is to analyze the performance of these different TCP variants. We used the NS-2 network simulator to perform experiments that will help you understand the behavior of the TCP variants under various load conditions and queuing algorithms.
